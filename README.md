# POC 82 â€“ RHDH RBAC Capabilities

This repository documents **Proof of Concept 82**, which focuses on testing and demonstrating the **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) capabilities** within **Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH)**.  

## Objective
- Validate that RHDH can enforce role-based access at different levels.
- Test integration of groups and permissions.
- Ensure default-deny behavior with explicit role-based allowances.
- Provide clear mapping of requirements to implementation.

## Requirements Overview
The following diagram summarizes the RBAC requirements identified for this POC:

## Next Steps
- Implement the RBAC model in the RHDH environment.
- Validate that only authorized roles can access defined plugins and actions.
- Document outcomes and gaps for feedback.
